# Example device insertion script.
# It can be necessary to load firmware into the device when it is first
# inserted. For example, scanbuttond backend does not know how to load 
# scanner firmware.
# A simple command "scanimage -L" invokes saned and it loads the appropriate
# firmware if necessary.
# This script receives environmental variables:
# SCANBD_DEVICE - device name (fixed string "dbus device" for dbus notification)
# SCANBD_ACTION - "insert" or "remove", so one script can be used.

# To use, add this line to "global" section of scanbd.conf:
# device_insert_script = "insert.script"
