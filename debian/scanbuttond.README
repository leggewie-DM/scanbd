What happened to scanbuttond?

scanbd is the successor to scanbuttond in Debian.

So, what now?

As a courtesy we provide a wrapper script that should work as
a drop-in replacement. Simply set the value of the "script"
variable to "scanbuttond_compat.script" everywhere in
/etc/scanbd/scanbd.conf.

Once you are comfortable with scanbd you can migrate away from
the wrapper and use the scanbd scripts directly.  Report a bug if
you run into trouble with your setup.
